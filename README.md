# Catan Counter Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically tracks game state for Settlers of Catan games played on [colonist.io](https://colonist.io). The extension monitors chat messages and maintains a real-time count of resources, development cards, dice rolls, and player statistics using advanced probabilistic variant tracking.

## Features

### üé≤ **Game State Tracking**

- **Player Resources**: Tracks wheat, sheep, brick, wood, and ore for all players
- **Development Cards**: Monitors knights, victory points, year of plenty, road builders, and monopolies
- **Dice Rolls**: Records frequency of all dice roll results (2-12)
- **Blocked Dice Tracking**: Monitors when robber blocks resource production by dice number and resource type
- **Building Counts**: Tracks settlements, cities, and roads remaining for each player
- **Victory Points**: Monitors VP progress for all players

### üìä **Enhanced User Interface**

- **Modern Overlay**: Clean, organized display with resource tables and dice roll charts
- **Probabilistic Resource Display**: Shows guaranteed resources plus probability of additional resources
- **Draggable & Resizable**: Move and scale the overlay to your preference
- **Minimize/Maximize**: Collapse to header-only for minimal screen usage
- **Responsive Tables**: Color-coded resource tracking with remaining bank resources
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual dice roll frequency with statistical bars

### üéØ **Smart Player Identification**

- **"You" Player Setup**: One-time dialog to identify your player for accurate tracking
- **Automatic Detection**: Triggers on first dice roll when all players are loaded
- **Message Reprocessing**: Re-analyzes all chat history once your identity is known
- **Enhanced Theft Tracking**: Properly handles "stole [resource] from you" messages

### üìä **Real-time Monitoring**

- **Live Updates**: Game state updates automatically as chat messages appear
- **Page Refresh Support**: Processes existing chat history when page is refreshed
- **Intelligent Processing**: Pauses during setup, then reprocesses for accuracy
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging

### üéØ **Supported Game Events**

- Resource collection from dice rolls
- Building placement (settlements, cities, roads)
- Development card purchases and usage
- Player-to-player trades
- Bank trades (4:1 and port trades)
- Resource stealing (robber and knight)
- **"From you" theft tracking** (requires player identification)
- Development card effects (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building)
- Resource discarding
- Starting resource distribution

### üß† **Advanced Variant-Based Probabilistic Tracking**

- **Variant Tree System**: When uncertainty exists (like unknown resource steals), creates a tree of possible game states with calculated probabilities
- **Smart Variant Resolution**: Automatically eliminates impossible variants when players take actions that reveal information
- **Dynamic Probability Calculations**: Real-time recalculation of resource probabilities as new information becomes available
- **Probabilistic Resource Display**: Shows minimum guaranteed resources and probability of having additional resources (e.g., "2 +67%" means at least 2 guaranteed, 67% chance of more)
- **Branch Elimination**: When players make offers or spend resources, impossible variants are automatically pruned
- **Automatic Deduction**: Single-resource-type steals are instantly resolved without creating variants

### Testing

The project uses Jest 30.0.2 with TypeScript support for comprehensive testing of the variant-based probabilistic system.

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (reruns on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in CI mode
npm run test:ci
```

#### Test Structure

Tests are organized with comprehensive coverage of game state management, chat parsing logic, and the variant-based probabilistic tracking system. The test suite includes both unit tests and integration tests with real HTML scenarios from colonist.io.

#### Writing Tests

- Tests use TypeScript with Jest globals (`@jest/globals`)
- DOM environment is mocked for browser extension testing
- Game state functions are thoroughly tested including the variant tree system
- Coverage targets: 80% for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- Helper functions like `expectMatchingVariantCombinations` for order-independent variant testing

#### Variant System Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive testing of the probabilistic variant tracking:

- **Variant creation** when unknown steals occur
- **Probability calculations** for different resource combinations
- **Variant resolution** when players take actions that eliminate possibilities
- **Complex multi-steal scenarios** with automatic branch pruning
- **Real-world game scenarios** with expected probability outcomes

## Usage

1. **Navigate to colonist.io** and start/join a Catan game

2. **Extension activates automatically** when it detects a game chat

3. **Player identification setup** - On the first dice roll, a dialog will appear asking you to identify which player you are. This enables accurate tracking of "from you" messages.

4. **View game state** in the enhanced overlay that appears in the top-right corner

5. **Interact with the overlay**:
   - **Drag** the header to move the overlay
   - **Minimize** using the (‚àí) button to collapse to header only
   - **Resize** by dragging the bottom-right corner to scale proportionally
6. **Monitor real-time updates** as the game progresses

### Game State Display

The overlay features an organized, visual layout with:

#### üìã **Resource Tables**

- **Main Resource Table**: Shows current known resource counts for each player
- **Probability Table**: Displays minimum guaranteed resources and probability of additional resources
- **Header columns** with resource emojis (üêëüåæüß±üå≤‚õ∞Ô∏è) and remaining bank resources
- **Color-coded cells** for easy resource identification
- **Probabilistic Display**: Format like "2 +67%" (2 guaranteed, 67% chance of more)

#### üìä **Dice Roll Chart**

- **Visual bar graph** showing frequency of each dice roll (2-12)
- **Roll counts** displayed above each bar
- **Color coding**: Red for 7, teal for 6&8, blue for others

#### üéõÔ∏è **Interactive Controls**

- **Header bar** for dragging and minimizing
- **Resize handle** in bottom-right corner for proportional scaling
- **Minimize button** to collapse to header-only view

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Modular TypeScript**: Organized into separate modules for maintainability
- **Rollup Bundling**: Multiple TypeScript files compiled into single JavaScript output
- **Content Script**: Injected into colonist.io pages
- **Chat Monitoring**: Uses MutationObserver to detect new messages
- **Pattern Matching**: Analyzes chat messages and HTML structure

- **Player theft scenarios** (including "from you" messages)
- **Unknown resource steals** with variant tree creation
- Special game events (robber movement, discarding, etc.)

### Variant-Based Probabilistic System

The extension features a sophisticated variant tree system for tracking uncertain game states:

#### Core Components

- **`Variant`**: Represents a single possible game state with probability
- **`VariantNode`**: Tree node containing variants with parent/child relationships
- **`VariantTree`**: Manages the complete tree of possible game states
- **`VariantTransactionProcessor`**: Handles transaction processing across variants
- **`PropbableGameState`**: Integrates variant system with game state management

#### Key Features

- **Probabilistic Resource Tracking**: Calculates exact probabilities based on known information
- **Smart Deduction**: Automatically resolves steals when victims have only one resource type
- **Branch Elimination**: Removes impossible variants when players reveal information through actions
- **Transaction Type Safety**: Uses discriminated unions for type-safe transaction processing
- **Real-time Recalculation**: Maintains accurate probabilities as game state evolves

#### Example Scenarios

- **Unknown Steal**: Player steals from someone with multiple resource types ‚Üí Creates variants for each possibility
- **Resource Offer**: Player offers resources they might not have ‚Üí Eliminates impossible variants
- **Building Action**: Player builds something requiring specific resources ‚Üí Resolves which variant was correct
- **Multiple Steals**: Handles complex scenarios with multiple unknown steals and their interactions

### Smart Reprocessing System

- **Player Detection**: Automatically identifies when player setup is needed
- **Processing Pause**: Stops processing new messages during player identification
- **Complete Reanalysis**: Re-examines all chat history with "you" player context
- **Accurate Attribution**: Ensures proper resource tracking for all theft events

### Modular Architecture

The codebase is organized into focused modules for better maintainability:

- **`types.ts`** - All TypeScript interface definitions and type declarations
- **`gameState.ts`** - Game state initialization, player management, and resource tracking
- **`gameStateWithVariants.ts`** - Enhanced game state with probabilistic variant tracking
- **`variants.ts`** - Core variant tree system classes
- **`variantTransactions.ts`** - Transaction processing for the variant system
- **`domUtils.ts`** - DOM element querying, resource parsing, and utility functions
- **`overlay.ts`** - Draggable game state overlay UI with probabilistic resource display
- **`chatParser.ts`** - Core chat message parsing logic handling 24+ game scenarios
- **`content.ts`** - Main entry point, initialization, and mutation observer setup

All modules are bundled into a single `content.js` file using Rollup for optimal browser performance.
